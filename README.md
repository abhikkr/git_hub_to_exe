# git_hub_to_exe
Leave the work with us..turn your git hub project in a stand alone executable.

Create a stand alone executable file in windows directly from your git hub link. This is a small project which accept only *.py file. 

One can run the my-script.sh from shell to start the project.

One can use the gui version of it.

If you have docker then run the projet from the docker file. Though the docker file need some changes.
